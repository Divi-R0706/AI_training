# Task-01
In this task, we build a simple Linear Regression model to predict future stock prices based on historical data. We load stock market data (such as Open, High, Low, Close prices), visualize the trend, and train a regression model to learn the relationship between past prices and future prices. The model then predicts the closing price for upcoming days.

# Task-02
This task analyzes messages to classify them as spam or ham using a Logistic Regression model. The dataset is split into 80% for training and 20% for testing. After cleaning and vectorizing the text, the model learns spam patterns and predicts whether new messages are spam with good accuracy.

# Task-03
In this task, we build a sentiment analysis model using synthetic text data and Naïve Bayes classifiers. We first convert the text into numerical features using CountVectorizer, which transforms sentences into word-frequency vectors. Using these vectorized inputs, we train both Multinomial and Bernoulli Naïve Bayes models to learn sentiment patterns and then classify new text as positive or negative.

# Task-05
This project uses a Decision Tree Classifier with Entropy to predict whether a customer will churn. After preprocessing and analyzing the dataset, the model learns patterns from features like tenure, total charges, and monthly charges. The trained model is then evaluated and visualized to understand how decisions are made.

# Task-06
In this task, we build a simple handwritten digit recognition model using PyTorch and a two-layer fully connected neural network. We load and preprocess the MNIST dataset, convert images into tensor features, and train the model to learn patterns that distinguish digits from 0 to 9. The trained network is then evaluated by plotting loss and accuracy curves and visualizing sample test images along with their predicted and true labels.
