# Stock_market_prediction
In this project, we build a simple Linear Regression model to predict future stock prices based on historical data. We load stock market data (such as Open, High, Low, Close prices), visualize the trend, and train a regression model to learn the relationship between past prices and future prices. The model then predicts the closing price for upcoming days.
